# Money Bags

My first game ever. It was terrible, but I had a blast making it as a part of the Ludum Dare 40 game jam. Play it on [Itch.io](https://rkuhl.itch.io/money-bags), if you dare.

It was written in Unity, so this repo contains the exported version of the game engine's representation of the game.
